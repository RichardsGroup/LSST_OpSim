Stylistic elements of these notebooks were guided by the DP0.1 notebooks developed by Melissa Graham and the Rubin Observatory Community Engagement Team."

The `jupyter` project has [extensive documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation), and there are numerous tutorial videos available, including a [very short one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5YyoCKxEOU) from the `jupyter` project itself, and a [more extensive talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFabWieskak) from SciPy 2019."
